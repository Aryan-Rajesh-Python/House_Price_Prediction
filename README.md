Itâ€™s a Data Science and Machine learning project in which the price of a house is determined based on the given inputs like number of bhk, total sqft, number of bathrooms and the location of the house. I have used numpy and pandas for data exploration and data cleaning, matplotlib for plotting the histograms and visualizing the data and machine learning algorithm - Linear Regression for building the model and used K-Fold cross validation algorithm in which I have taken k=5 folds and found the scores of 5 folds of linear regression and I have used the GridSearchCV algorithm to evaluate the best suitable model among Lasso Regression, Decision Tree and Linear Regression and I have achieved an accuracy of 84.8% in predicting the price of a house.
